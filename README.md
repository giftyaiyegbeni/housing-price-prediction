Building regression models to predict housing prices on the Boston housing dataset

In this project, the aim was to predict housing prices using two different regression models: Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression. 

**Linear Regression:** This model explained approximately 66.9% of the variance in housing prices, indicating its ability to capture patterns within the data. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.93 highlighted the average difference between predicted and actual housing prices. While this model provided a reasonable understanding of the data, it didn't capture the complexity of the relationships present.

**Decision Tree Regression:** On the other hand, the Decision Tree Regression model performed significantly better. It explained about 85.0% of the variance in housing prices, showcasing its ability to grasp intricate patterns within the dataset. The RMSE of 3.32 indicated a lower average prediction error compared to Linear Regression. This model, being non-linear, could capture more complex relationships in the data, leading to superior predictive accuracy.

In essence, the Decision Tree Regression model excelled in this task due to its capability to handle intricate data patterns, making it a more effective choice for predicting housing prices in the given Boston housing dataset.
